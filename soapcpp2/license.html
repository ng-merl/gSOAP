3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.</h2>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b>3.1. Application of License.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.
The Source Code version of Covered Code including Compiled Code may be distributed only under the
terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code or Compiled Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described
in Section <b>3.5</b>.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients.
You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source
Code if a contact means is provided. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source
Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made
available.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code or Compiled Code provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer
in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
of the Covered Code.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</b></dt>
	<dd>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b>(a) Third Party Claims.</b></dt>
	<dd>
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or
code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code
distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
Modification available as described in Section <b>3.2</b>, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
that new knowledge has been obtained.</dd>
 <dt><b>(b) Contributor APIs.</b></dt>
	<dd>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in
the LEGAL file.</dd>
 <dt><b>(c) Representations.</b></dt>
	<dd>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
<b>3.4(a)</b> above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</dd>
</dl>
<br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.5. Required Notices.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the
Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice
in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit
A</b>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
of Section <b>3.1</b>-<b>3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code
is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>.
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of any such terms You offer.
If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in <b>Exhibit
B</b> in the
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>3.8. Restrictions.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
You may not transfer rights to the Covered Code or Compiler.</dd>

4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.</h2>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all distributions
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.</h2>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.

version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License.
<br /><br />
</dd>
 <dt><b>6.3. Derivative Works.</b></dt>
	<dd><br />
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrase ''gSOAP'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in
the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall not of themselves be deemed
to be modifications of this License.)</dd>
