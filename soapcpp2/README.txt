
Thanks for using gSOAP!

SOAP Web Services is an emerging technology. SOAP enables cross-platform
development of networked applications.

* The gSOAP compiler and run-time are stable since version 2.1.3

* The gSOAP WSDL importer tool is BETA 0.9.1

The software is provided "as is", without any warranty. However, gSOAP
has received a lot of support from users and has been extensively tested
in the real world. We also continue to improve gSOAP and add new features.

DISCLAIMER:
WE TRY OUR BEST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH "REAL-WORLD" EXAMPLES BUT WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE THAT ALL CLIENT EXAMPLES CAN CONNECT TO THIRD PARTY WEB SERVICES
WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE DOWN OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

LICENSE:
gSOAP is distributed under a public open source license based on the Mozilla
public license 1.1. See license.html or license.pdf for further details.
The license allows for commercial use of gSOAP. It also allows products to be
built on top and distributed under any license (including commercial).
Products developed with gSOAP should include a notice of copyright and a
disclaimer of warranty in the product's documentation (License Exhibit B).
Modifications made to the gSOAP source codes and that are distributed part of
an open source product need to be submitted back to us for quality control.
(Note: modifications to the gSOAP runtime source codes are not required to
build applications so this requirement does not prohibit (commercial) product
development in any way.)

USE RESTRICTIONS:
You may not: (i) transfer rights to gSOAP or claim authorship; or (ii) remove

DOCS:

See soapdoc2.html or soapdoc2.pdf for the gSOAP documentation.

LIBS:
Win32 build of clients and services requires winsock.dll. To do this in
Visual C++ 6.0, go to "Project", "settings", select the "Link" tab (the
project file needs to be selected in the file view) and add "wsock32.lib" to
the "Object/library modules" entry. The Win32 distribution contains two
MSVC++ project examples. The custom build in VC++ 6.0 has been configured to
invoke the gSOAP compiler automatically. The VC++ projects can be converted to
MSVC++ 7.0.
