#	This file contains custom definitions of the XML schema types and
#	C/C++ types for your project, and XML namespace prefix definitions.
 
#	XML namespace prefix definitions can be provided to override the
#	default choice of ns1, ns2, ... prefixes. For example:

s	= "http://www.soapinterop.org/xsd"

#	Type definitions consists of a single line containing:
#	type = declaration | use | pointer-use
#	where
#	type is the XML schema type (or an application type in a namespace
#		that has a prefix definition given as above).
#	declaration is an optional C/C++ type declaration
#	use is how the type is referred to in code
#	pointer-use is how the type should be referred to as a pointer (opt)
#	Example XML schema and C/C++ type bindings:

xsd__int	= | int
# xsd__boolean = enum xsd__boolean { false_, true_ }; | enum xsd__boolean
# xsd__base64Binary = class xsd__base64Binary { unsigned char *__ptr; int __size; }; | xsd__base64Binary | xsd__base64Binary
